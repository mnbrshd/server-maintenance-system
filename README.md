## Overview

This project simulates (or optionally integrates with real) servers and monitors key performance indicators—CPU, memory, uptime, and temperature—against configurable rules to deliver predictive maintenance insights. It provides real-time dashboards, alerting mechanisms, historical logs, and optional integration with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Features

- Rule-based engine with customizable metrics and thresholds  
- Server simulation or real-time data collection via `psutil`  
- Full REST API powered by FastAPI (with pagination, filtering, validation, error handling, rate limiting)  
- Secure JWT-based user authentication and scoped access  
- Alerting and logging of maintenance triggers  
- React-based frontend dashboard for monitoring, trends, and alerts  
- Optional Prometheus & Grafana monitoring stack  
- Containerized with Docker and deployable to AWS environments
